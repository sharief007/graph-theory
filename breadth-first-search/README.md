# Breadth First Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level, starting from a chosen source node. It visits all the immediate neighbors of the source node first, then moves on to their neighbors, and so forth, until it has visited all reachable nodes.

### Examples

let's consider a few different types of graphs and perform BFS on them.

### Graph 1: Undirected Unweighted Graph

```
   0 -- 1 -- 2
   |    |    |
   3 -- 4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 2: Directed Graph

```
   0 -> 1 -> 2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 3: Disconnected Graph

```
   0 -- 1    2
   |    |    |
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4

### Graph 4: Disconnected Directed Graph

```
   0 -> 1    2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4

### Graph 5: Tree

```
       0
      / \
     1   2
    / \   \
   3   4   5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 2 3 4 5

### Graph 6: Disconnected Tree

```
       0         6
      / \         \
     1   2         7
    / \   \       /
   3   4   5     8
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 2 3 4 5

### Graph 7: Graph with Loops

```
   0 -- 1 -- 2
   |    |    |
   3 -- 4 -- 5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 8: Disconnected Graph with a Loop

```
   0 -- 1    2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3 -- 4 -- 5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- BFS: 0 1 3 4

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BFS {
    // Method to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    public static void bfs(List<List<Integer>> graph, int source) {
        // Initialize an array to keep track of visited nodes
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[graph.size()];
        
        // Initialize a queue for BFS
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Mark the source node as visited and enqueue it
        visited[source] = true;
        queue.offer(source);
        
        // Continue until the queue is empty
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            // Dequeue a node and process it
            int current = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(current + " ");
            
            // Visit and enqueue unvisited neighbors
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(current)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, where every node is reachable from the source, BFS visits every node once, which gives a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(V) for the visited array and O(V) for the queue, giving a total of O(V).
