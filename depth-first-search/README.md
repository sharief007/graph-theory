# Depth First Search

Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching through a tree or graph data structure. It starts at a chosen node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means it goes as deep as possible down one branch before moving to the next branch.

### Examples

let's consider a few different types of graphs and perform DFS on them.

### Graph 1: Undirected Unweighted Graph

```
   0 -- 1 -- 2
   |    |    |
   3 -- 4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 4 3 2 5

### Graph 2: Directed Graph

```
   0 -> 1 -> 2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 3: Disconnected Graph

```
   0 -- 1    2
   |    |    |
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 4 3

### Graph 4: Disconnected Directed Graph

```
   0 -> 1    2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3    4    5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 3 4

### Graph 5: Tree

```
       0
      / \
     1   2
    / \   \
   3   4   5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 6: Disconnected Tree

```
       0         6
      / \         \
     1   2         7
    / \   \       /
   3   4   5     8
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 3 4 2 5

### Graph 7: Graph with Loops

```
   0 -- 1 -- 2
   |    |    |
   3 -- 4 -- 5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 4 3 5 2

### Graph 8: Disconnected Graph with a Loop

```
   0 -- 1    2
   |    |    |
   v    v    v
   3 -- 4 -- 5
```

**Traversal Results starting from node 0**:
- DFS: 0 1 4 3

### Implementation

```java
class Graph {
    // Method to perform DFS starting from a given source node
    public void dfs(List<List<Integer>> graph, int source) {
        int size = graph.size();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[size]; // Array to keep track of visited nodes
        dfsUtil(graph, source, visited); // Start DFS from the source node
        
        // If there are unvisited nodes, perform DFS on them
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfsUtil(graph, i, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    // Recursive method for performing DFS
    public void dfsUtil(List<List<Integer>> graph, int source, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[source] = true; // Mark the current node as visited
        System.out.print(source + " "); // Print the current node

        // Visit all the neighbors of the current node
        for(int neighbour: graph.get(source)) {
            if (!visited[neighbour]) {
                dfsUtil(graph, neighbour, visited); // Recursive call for unvisited neighbors
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
