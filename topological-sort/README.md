# Topological Sorting 

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. In simpler terms, it helps organize tasks or elements in a way that respects the dependencies between them.

## Applications

Topological sorting has several practical applications:

- **Task Scheduling:** In project management, tasks often have dependencies on each other. Topological sorting helps in determining a valid order of execution.

- **Compiler Design:** Compilers use topological sorting during code generation to ensure that all dependencies (like variable declarations and definitions) are resolved correctly.

- **Package Management:** Package managers like npm, pip, and others use topological sorting to install packages in the correct order, ensuring that dependencies are met.

- **Course Scheduling:** In academic institutions, where courses have prerequisites, topological sorting helps in scheduling courses such that students can take them in the correct order.

## Limitations

Topological sorting is applicable only to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).A DAG is a graph in which there are no cycles, meaning you can't start at a vertex and follow a sequence of directed edges to return to that same vertex.

 It cannot be applied to graphs with cycles because there's no way to order the vertices such that all edges point in the correct direction.

## Examples

### Chain

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  B --> C;
  C --> D;
  D --> E;
```

Topological Sorting Result: A, B, C, D, E

### Fork

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  A --> C;
  B --> D;
  C --> D;
```

Topological Sorting Result: A, B, C, D

### Diamond

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  A --> C;
  B --> D;
  C --> D;
```

Topological Sorting Result: A, B, C, D

### Complex DAG

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  A --> C;
  B --> D;
  B --> E;
  C --> E;
  D --> F;
  E --> F;
  F --> G;
```

Topological Sorting Result: A, C, B, E, D, F, G

### Disconnected Components

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  C --> D;
```

Topological Sorting Result: A, C, B, D

### Cyclic Graph

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A --> B;
  B --> C;
  C --> D;
  D --> A;
```

This graph contains a cycle, so topological sorting is not possible.

## Implementation

### Complexity Analysis

Kahn's Algorithm for topological sorting has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

1. **Initialization and In-Degree Calculation:**
   - For each vertex, we initialize the in-degree to 0, which takes O(V) operations.
   - Then, we iterate through the edges to calculate the in-degrees. This takes O(E) operations.

2. **Finding Nodes with No Incoming Edges:**
   - In the worst case, all vertices could have no incoming edges, which would take O(V) operations.

3. **Performing Topological Sorting:**
   - In the worst case, we process each edge once, which takes O(E) operations.
   - For each edge, we may add a node to the result list and update the in-degrees, which takes constant time.

4. **Checking if Topological Sorting is Possible:**
   - After the loop, we check if the result list contains all vertices, which takes O(V) operations.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the calculations involving the edges, giving us a total time complexity of O(V + E).

The space complexity of Kahn's Algorithm is O(V), primarily due to the data structures used to store in-degrees and the queue.

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the DFS-based topological sorting algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm must visit every vertex and edge once.

- Visiting a vertex takes constant time (O(1)).
- Visiting an edge takes constant time (O(1)).
- Since we may visit every vertex and edge once, the overall time complexity is O(V + E).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the DFS implementation is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This space is primarily used for:

- The `visited` set (O(V)) to keep track of visited nodes.
- The `stack` (O(V)) used for the depth-first search.
- Recursive call stack for the DFS (O(V)).

In practice, the space complexity can vary depending on the specific graph structure and the order in which nodes are visited. However, the worst-case space complexity is O(V + E).
